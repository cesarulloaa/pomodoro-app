# Pomodoro Timer App

This is a Pomodoro timer app built with React Native. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This app allows users to set Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break intervals, and it provides a visual and audio cue when the timer ends. Users can start and stop the timer as needed.

## Features
- Set Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break intervals.
- Visual indication of the current timer interval with color changes.
- Start and stop the timer with a button press.
- Audio alert when the timer ends.
- Compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
